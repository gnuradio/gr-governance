# Asynchronous Vote NumFOCUS Affiliate Member

The GA has voted to join NumFOCUS as an Affiliate Member (an application had been previously filled out and NumFOCUS approved it). The vote concluded on 18-June-2021 with a result
of 9 Yes, 2 No Opinion, 0 No, 3 non-voters. The vote was made live on 4-June-2021 to comply with the two-week voting period, and the ADoodle.org system was used for the first time,
it proved to be much easier to use than CIVS, and the results were presented much better than CIVS, plus CIVS now requires all email addresses be verified before the vote can
be started, which is a hurdle we rather not deal with.
